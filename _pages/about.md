I am a Research at FAIR Meta NYC. I completed my PhD in [Applied Math and Computational Sciences](https://amcs.upenn.edu/) at University of Pennsylvania (specializing in game theory) in May 2018, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Rakesh V. Vohra](https://sites.google.com/site/quaerereverum9/). Prior to Penn, I graduated with an BSc in mathematics at Nanjing University in 2013.

My research has focused on Large Language Models (LLM): self-training and alignment algorithms in general.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge. -->
